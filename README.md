# Bank-Churners-Analysis
This repository contains the SQL file of bank churners.

OBJECTIVE: 
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn in a bank. The dataset contains information about 10k bank customers including demographics, account information and whether they have exited the bank. The goal is to explore factors associated with churn and identify patterns or trends that may help reduce customer attrition.

TASKS:
- Calculate churn rate.
- Compare churn rates across demographics.
- Explore factors associated with churn.

  KEY TAKEWAYS:
  - The churn rate for female customers is aproximately 25.07% while the churn rate for male customers is aproximately 16.46%.
    Female customers have a higher churn rate as compared to male customers.
  - Churned customers have an average credit score of approximately 645, while non-churned customers have a slightly higher average credit score of around 652.
    The maximum credit score observed for both churned and non-churned customers is 850, suggesting that there are customers with excellent credit scores in both groups as well.
  - Number of non churned customers decreases gradually towards both ends of the tenure spectrum (0 and 10 years).
    There is a relatively consistent distribution of non churned customers in the middle tenures (2 to 9 years).
  - The highest count of churned customers is observed at the tenure length of 1 having 232 customers aproximately.
    The number of churned customers decreases gradually with increasing tenure.
  - Customer under 30 age group has the lowest average churn rate. They are less likely to churn compared to other age groups.
    Customers under the age group 50 and above likely has the highest churn rate. Older customers may be more inclined to switch banks due to retirement, relocation, or changes in financial needs.
